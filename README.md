Just having fun with Val Schorre's META II compiler.
`m2.c` is the compiler,
`asm2c.awk` converts its output into something usable by C.

`meta2.code` was initially bootstrapped by myself by running META II through itself in my head.

`valgol2.m2` is the META II code for his VALGOL II language.

TODO:
`m2.c` and `v2.c` are really the same code right now.
Should clean this up.
